# Mapping Local Communities Javascript and Qualtrics Project

This repository contains the javascript and other files for the Mapping Local Communities project where we hope to combine hand-drawn maps with  a Qualtrics survey. 

The survey itself occurs in Qualtrics. The javascript has to be cut and pasted into the Javascript areas within Qualtrics.
